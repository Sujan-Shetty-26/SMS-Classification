# SMS-Classification
SMS (Short Message Service) classification is a common application of natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing text messages into predefined categories or labels. 
Objective:
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages into relevant categories, such as spam or ham (non-spam). This can be achieved by leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Tools and Libraries:

Jupyter Notebook: A versatile and interactive environment for data analysis, code development, and visualization.
Python: A programming language commonly used for machine learning and data science.
Pandas: A data manipulation library for handling and analyzing structured data.
Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): A library for natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stemming.
Steps:

Data Collection:

Acquire a dataset containing labeled SMS messages, with indications of whether each message is spam or ham.
Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
Explore and clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies.
Text Preprocessing:

Tokenize the SMS messages into individual words or tokens.
Remove stop words, punctuation, and perform stemming to reduce words to their root form.
Feature Extraction:

Convert the processed text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Model Building:

Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for SMS classification, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forests.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize its performance.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for real-world use, such as classifying incoming SMS messages in an application or system.
